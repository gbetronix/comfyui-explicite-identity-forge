"""Generate manifest.json for the NUDITY gallery.

    python gallery/nudity/build_manifest.py --images <dir>

=============================================================================
 THIS FILE IS ONE OF THREE NEAR-IDENTICAL COPIES
 gallery/nudity/build_manifest.py - gallery/archetypes/build_manifest.py -
 gallery/creatures/build_manifest.py
 They differ ONLY in the GALLERY CONFIG block below. Fix a bug here and apply
 it to the other two (see gallery/README.md).
=============================================================================

``publish.py`` calls this against the images that are actually on ``gh-pages``,
which is what makes "an entry you did not supply is left alone" true. Running it
by hand against some *other* folder describes that folder instead -- fine for a
local preview, dangerous if you then publish it. ``publish.py`` never does that.

    Three separate things Windows does to a name on its way to disk, each of which

    * **Trailing period dropped** -- the entry ``C.C.`` lands as ``C.C.jpeg``.
      Without this, that entry was reported as *both* missing an image and having
      an orphaned one, on every single run.
    * **Illegal characters removed** -- ``B-Boy / B-Girl`` is saved as
      ``B-Boy  B-Girl.jpeg``. Substituting a space (not the empty string) is what
      makes the stripped filename and the original label converge, since the label
      already has spaces either side of the slash.
    * **Whitespace runs** -- the substitution above leaves a double space, and a
      hand-typed filename may differ in spacing anyway. Collapsing both sides makes
      ``B-Boy  B-Girl`` and ``B-Boy B-Girl`` the same key.

    Callers that build a *filename* use this too, so the canonical on-disk form is
    whatever this returns. NFC last, so a decomposed accent from a Mac-authored
    filename matches a composed one in the roster.
