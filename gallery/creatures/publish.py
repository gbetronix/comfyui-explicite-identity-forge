"""Publish the CREATURE gallery: optimize, stage and push, in one pass.

    python gallery/creatures/publish.py --source <dir>              # add missing only

=============================================================================
 THIS FILE IS ONE OF THREE NEAR-IDENTICAL COPIES
 gallery/cosplay/publish.py - gallery/archetypes/publish.py -
 gallery/creatures/publish.py
 They differ ONLY in the GALLERY CONFIG block below. Fix a bug here and apply
 it to the other two (see gallery/README.md).
=============================================================================

THE SAFETY MODEL, which is the whole point of this script:

  * ``gh-pages`` is the source of truth for what is published. The manifest is
    rebuilt from the files that are actually on the branch AFTER staging, never
    from the source folder.
  * The source folder only ever ADDS or OVERWRITES. An entry you did not supply
    an image for is not touched, not re-encoded, and above all not deleted.
  * Nothing is removed unless you pass ``--prune-orphans``, and even then only
    images whose filename matches no roster entry at all - i.e. a creature that
    was renamed or deleted in the data, never one that is merely absent from
    this run's source folder.

The predecessor (``deploy.py``, removed at 0.80.0) got this wrong in a way that
could have destroyed the gallery: it built the manifest from the source folder,
so pointing it at a folder of five new images marked every other entry as
image-less, and its prune step would then have deleted them all from the branch.

It also switched branches in place with ``git stash``/``git checkout``, which
runs over whatever is in your working tree. This uses ``git worktree`` instead,
which touches the current checkout not at all.
