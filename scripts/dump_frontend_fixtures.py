"""Generate ``tests/frontend/fixtures/nodes.json`` from live ``define_schema()``.

The jsdom frontend tests (``tests/frontend/*.test.mjs``) need to know, for each
node, the widgets a real ComfyUI would build and the order they'd appear in —
without that, a test asserting "every field lands in the right group" would be
checking a hand-typed list against another hand-typed list, proving nothing
about the actual Python schema. This script derives that list from the real
``io.ComfyNode.define_schema()`` output (using the ``comfy_api`` stub in
``tests/comfy_stub`` when no real ComfyUI is installed — see
``tests/__init__.py``), so a Python schema change that isn't matched on the
JS side shows up as a stale fixture, not a passing test that means nothing.

Widget vs. link-only socket: an ``Input`` with no ``default`` attribute (only
``Image.Input`` in this pack) is a pure socket, never a widget. A
``WidgetInput`` whose ``force_input`` is set is *also* a pure socket — that's
how ``archetype_json`` / ``upstream`` / ``prompt_json`` become connectable
sockets instead of text boxes on the node face (see each node's own comment
at the call site). Everything else becomes one ``widgets_values`` entry, in
schema-list order; an ``Int.Input`` with a truthy ``control_after_generate``
contributes a second, synthetic sibling widget of that name, exactly as
ComfyUI's own frontend auto-adds one next to a seed.

Usage (from the repo root)::

    python scripts/dump_frontend_fixtures.py            # write the fixture
    python scripts/dump_frontend_fixtures.py --check    # fail if out of date (CI)
