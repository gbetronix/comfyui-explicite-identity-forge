"""Render, record and publish the gallery images for roster entries.

The three galleries show one image per cosplayer, archetype and creature.
Keeping ~2,200 of those honest by hand is not possible, so the build is
content-addressed: every image records a hash of the entry that produced it,
and an entry whose text has changed is reported stale until it is re-rendered.

    python scripts/render_gallery.py --check            # the CI gate
    python scripts/render_gallery.py --missing          # render what is absent
    python scripts/render_gallery.py --inherited        # the fork-ownership convergence pass
    python scripts/render_gallery.py --kind cosplay --entry "Jack Skellington" --publish
    python scripts/render_gallery.py --entry "Hisoka Morow" --dry-run   # read the prose

``--check`` is the gate. It needs no GPU, no ComfyUI and no network: it compares
``gallery/render_manifest.json`` against the data layer and fails when they have
drifted, so editing an entry tells you its image is now a lie.

Rendering needs a running ComfyUI (default the disposable test instance on
:8288). Two design decisions are worth knowing before changing anything here:

* **The prompt is resolved in this process, not by the instance.** An entry name
  is a dropdown widget value on the preset nodes, and a running ComfyUI caches
  its data layer at startup - it would reject a brand-new name at ``/prompt``
  validation until restarted. So this script imports the real preset builders
  and the engine node, calls them in the same order the workflows wire them, and posts
  a graph containing **no Identity Forge nodes at all**: just the loaders, a
  ``CLIPTextEncode`` fed the finished literal string, sampler, decode. The target
  instance never has to know the entry exists, nothing is installed on it, and no
  restart is ever needed.
* **Nothing is left behind on the instance.** The graph ends in ``PreviewImage``,
  which writes to ComfyUI's temp dir and is fetched straight back over HTTP;
  ComfyUI clears it on its own. ``--save-originals`` switches to ``SaveImage``
  when full-resolution originals are wanted on the ComfyUI side.

Queue etiquette: prompts go in front-of-queue (``{"front": true}``), which
inserts at position 0 of ``queue_pending``, leaves already-queued jobs untouched
and does not interrupt the running job. ``/interrupt`` and ``DELETE /queue`` are

Explicit samples: this is a prompt generator for pornography, and the gallery is
its showcase. Every sample therefore renders at an explicit tier -
``_gallery_wardrobe`` pins ``wardrobe_level`` per entry (deterministic, seeded;
60 % fully nude, 15 % topless, 15 % lingerie, 10 % swimwear, **never
Clothed**), ``_gallery_act`` pins a non-neutral ``explicit_act``, and
``_strip_preset_clothing`` recursively drops every preset's locked garment
(cosplay included - the signature face, makeup and prop stay, the body gets
the seed's dress code) so the tier can dress the body.
