"""Tests for the three gallery publishing pipelines.

The galleries are deliberately **copy-and-adapt**: `gallery/cosplay/`,
`gallery/archetypes/` and `gallery/creatures/` each own their scripts rather than
sharing a package. That is the maintainer's call (a shared module would couple
three independently-published sites), but it means an improvement made to one
copy can silently rot in the other two.

`CopiesStayInSyncTests` turns that from a documentation note into an enforced
invariant: everything outside each file's docstring and its GALLERY CONFIG block
must be byte-identical across the three. If you fix a bug in one, this test fails
until you have fixed it in all three.

The rest pins the safety property the whole design exists for: **an entry you did
not supply an image for is never touched, and never deleted.**
