"""ExpliciteIdentityForgeTurnaround node — one resolved character, every camera view at once.

A reference-set builder for image models that accept several views of the same
character (a turnaround: front, three-quarters, profile, back). It takes a
**resolved** character — the ``prompt_json`` output of
:class:`~nodes.identity_forge.ExpliciteIdentityForge` — and emits the whole set of views
as a **list**, so a single queue renders all of them.

Wiring::

    Cosplayer/Archetype -> Identity Forge -(prompt_json)-> Turnaround
                                                              |
                                              (prompt x N) ---+--> CLIPTextEncode -> ...

**One ownership line, and it is the whole design.** Identity Forge owns the
character and the scene; this node owns *only* the camera. That is why it
re-exposes none of the main node's ~80 widgets: the first draft (0.98.0) carried
copies of six steering controls, which meant a user of the Turnaround silently
lost the other seventy-odd, could not tell which node's copy won, and had a third
``seed`` competing with the one on every upstream preset. Taking a resolved
document instead deletes the question rather than documenting an answer.

Why a list output rather than an auto-incrementing ``index`` widget:

* **Identity stability.** The upstream nodes run ONCE per queue, so all N views
  come from the same resolution. With an index widget, an upstream node left on
  ``control_after_generate="randomize"`` re-rolled the character between queues
  and the "turnaround" was six angles on six different people. That is the
  failure this rewrite exists to remove.
* **One queue, N renders.** ``is_output_list=True`` makes ComfyUI run everything
  downstream once per element (``execution.py`` -> ``merge_result_data``), and
  shorter inputs — the negative prompt, the model, the latent — broadcast off
  their last element, so an ordinary graph needs no rewiring.
* **No cache hack.** With no auto-advancing widget and no RNG this node is a pure
  function of its inputs, so it needs no ``fingerprint_inputs`` (contrast the
  four seeded nodes — architecture.md -> "Seeded nodes re-roll every queue").

Why the resolved document is enough to re-render from: ``prompt_json`` is
self-describing by contract — it is exactly what Vault Save writes and Vault Load
feeds back through ``archetype_json``, with every field concrete. Re-running the
engine over it with only ``shot_type`` (and optionally ``pose``) overridden
therefore reproduces the character exactly; the seed cannot move anything,
because nothing is left to randomize.

Text-only, zero new dependencies, no IMAGE anywhere.
