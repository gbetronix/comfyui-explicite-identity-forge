"""ExpliciteIdentityForgeCosplayer node — fictional characters as a worn cosplay look.

Pick (or randomize) a fictional character and emit a JSON document of overrides.
Wire its ``character_json`` output into the ``archetype_json`` input of an
:class:`~nodes.identity_forge.ExpliciteIdentityForge` node. The character's costume defines
the *look* and ExpliciteIdentityForge randomizes the person underneath, so every run is a
different individual cosplaying the same character.

Presets chain: connect another preset's ``character_json`` into the optional
``upstream`` input and they stack into one document (this node wins on overlap),
so Archetype and Cosplayer nodes can all stay wired at once. Set a node to
``None`` and it simply passes its upstream through.

Two look levels:

* **Costume only** (default) — only the costume and a few signature look traits
  (hair, eyes) are sent, so body, face, and demographics stay free to randomize.
  This is the "a random person cosplaying X" mode.
* **Full character** — also locks the character's physique (body type, height,
  skin tone, …) for a faithful reproduction; the scene still randomizes.

Full-mask characters (``covers_face``) carry their head covering in a separate
``mask`` field. The node's ``mask`` widget defaults to keeping it on (face/hair
suppressed); ``"Unmask (show face)"`` drops it so the randomized head shows under
the suit — a helmet-off look. It is a no-op for face-visible characters.

Characters with a signature held prop (Thor's hammer, Captain America's shield)
carry it in an optional ``prop`` field. The ``props`` widget is **off by default**
("worn, not held" stays the norm); ``"Include signature prop"`` emits the prop as
the hidden ``held_item`` lock, voiced downstream as "holding …". It is a no-op for
characters without a ``prop``.

When the signature object is *worn* in the costume rather than held (a bullwhip
coiled on a belt, swords sheathed at a hip), the entry also carries an optional
``prop_costume``: the identical look with that object removed. Switching the prop
on swaps it in, so the item moves from the belt to the hand instead of rendering
twice. See ``build_cosplayer_json``.

The *person's* gender is chosen on the ExpliciteIdentityForge node, independent of the
character's, so crossplay (e.g. a man cosplaying a female character) works: the
downstream gender gate drops any value invalid for the chosen gender. The source
character's gender here only scopes the "Random — female / male" picks.

The engine half (:func:`build_cosplayer_json`) is a pure function, testable
without ComfyUI.

#: problem (``scale_prose`` replaces ``height``, a body-paint colour replaces

#:
#: **Bias-free by construction**: nothing is ever drawn from the global ``pose`` pool
#: for a feral entry, so no family weight moves and no other entry is affected. The

#: Every value must complete "He/She/They is ..." -- the pose clause is a bare
#: ``{subject} is {pose}``, so a noun-absolute ("head lowered and turned toward the

#: (which the constraints in data/constraints.py cascade to clear every cosmetic
#: sub-field, and which _is_absent() treats as omitted so the whole makeup sentence
#: drops): the umbrella style word ("soft glam", "dewy look", ...) implies a face
#: foundation that t2i models render as a pale base *under* the paint, leaving the
#: face light while the body is coloured (the She-Hulk / Satana pale-face bug). With

#:
#: ``ethnicity`` joined at 0.78.0 for the same reason the rest of this map exists.
#: It had been the one skin-describing field left randomizing under a full-body

#: token to the ethnicity, rendering an ordinary human face above a coloured body.
#: That is the Lobo report ("a hispanic guy wearing Lobo's clothes but not his
#: face") and it reproduces at every seed. Same argument, same verdict as 0.65.0,
#: which added ``ethnicity`` to ``_CONCEALED_SHELL_SKIN_FIELDS`` for fully-encased
#: characters: when no natural skin is visible there is nothing for an ethnicity to
#: attach to, so naming one only fights the colour the costume just established.

    like the scope was ignored even though it is working. Printing the pool size
    once per (character, scope, pool) combo makes the scope legible without
    spamming the console every generation. ``pool`` (the `random_pool` widget)
    joins the cache key at 1.1.0: a different pool over the same scope is a
    genuinely different combo and must not be silently suppressed by the first
    one's announcement.

    ``outcome`` distinguishes the two degraded cases, which are very different for
    the user: :data:`_SCOPE_GENDER_RELAXED` still honours the franchise they asked
    for (only the *source* gender was dropped, which crossplay makes harmless),

    signature look is emitted; ``"Full character"`` also locks the physique.

    ``mask_mode`` only affects full-mask characters (those with ``covers_face``

    ``include_prop`` (default ``False``) adds the character's signature held prop
    (e.g. Thor's hammer) as the hidden ``held_item`` lock, voiced downstream as
    "holding …". It is a no-op for characters without a ``prop``. When the entry
    also defines ``prop_costume`` — the same look with a *worn* signature object
    removed — that costume is swapped in, so Indiana Jones' whip leaves his belt
    when it reaches his hand rather than being rendered twice.

    ``random_scope`` (default ``"Any"``) limits the ``"Random — …"`` picks to one
