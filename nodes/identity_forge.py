"""IdentityForge node — character description randomizer with constraint engine.

This module is split in two halves:

* **Engine** — pure functions (``generate_character`` and helpers) with no
  ComfyUI dependency, so they can be unit-tested without a ComfyUI install.
* **Node** — the V3 ``io.ComfyNode`` wrapper, only defined when ``comfy_api``
  is importable.

Design notes
------------
* ``gender`` and ``hair_color_scope`` are *control* fields (``"control": True``
  in :data:`data.fields.FIELD_DEFINITIONS`). They are read straight from their
  widgets, never randomized, and never emitted as descriptive text — they steer
  the option pools instead.
* A value that means "absent" (``"None"``, ``"no bag"``, ``"clean shaven"`` …)
  is skipped in the prose for readability but kept in the JSON for fidelity.
* The prose summarizes; the JSON is the complete, structured record.

#: Fields that never get a user-facing widget (engine-generated).
_HIDDEN_FIELDS: frozenset[str] = frozenset({"outfit_description", "held_item"})

#: Hidden fields that are nonetheless honoured as preset-supplied locks (a costume
#: override and a cosplayer's signature prop). Everything else hidden is engine-only.
#:
#: **These two sets are EQUAL today, and that is not an accident worth collapsing.**
#: An audit flagged them as "identical twin constants"; the names are not redundant,
#: the *membership* happens to coincide because both hidden fields are currently
#: preset-supplied. The consequence is that
#: ``name not in _HIDDEN_FIELDS or name in _PRESET_HIDDEN_FIELDS`` is a tautology
#: right now -- it is kept because it is the clause that starts doing work the moment
#: a third engine-only hidden field is added, and rediscovering that requirement
#: after the fact is far more expensive than the dead branch. ``HiddenFieldTests``
#: pins the subset relation the clause depends on.
_PRESET_HIDDEN_FIELDS: frozenset[str] = frozenset({"outfit_description", "held_item"})

#: Fields drawn AFTER the main randomization loop, because their pool depends on the
#: finished ``outfit_description`` -- and for a randomly generated character that
#: string does not exist yet while the loop is running. It is composed afterwards,
#: from ``outfit_style``, in :func:`generate_character`.
#:
#: This bit us for real: gating ``legwear`` and ``tattoo_placement`` inside the loop
#: read an empty outfit every time, so legwear never appeared at all (0 in 2,000) and
#: forearm tattoos rendered under blazers. The symptom looked like two bad regexes;
#: the cause was one ordering mistake. Note that :func:`_performable_poses` reads the
#: same key from inside the loop and therefore only ever sees a PRESET costume -- for
#: a randomly generated outfit its garment check is inert. That is pre-existing and
#: is left alone here, but it is the same trap.
#: ``tattoos`` is here for a different reason from the other two: it needs no outfit
#: at all, but drawing it inside the loop would consume RNG *before*
#: ``_resolve_outfit_description``, shifting the outfit -- and therefore the whole
#: character -- for every existing seed. Deferring all three puts every new draw
#: after the last pre-existing one, so an identical seed yields an identical
#: character plus the new clauses. Verified, not assumed: see the seed-stability
#: check in tests/test_engine.py.
_DEFERRED_FIELDS: frozenset[str] = frozenset({"tattoos", "legwear", "tattoo_placement"})

#: The one shot_type value that occupies a hand (holding the camera at arm's length),
#: same as a held prop. Read by _performable_poses so a selfie never draws a
#: both-hands pose.
_SELFIE_SHOT_TYPE: str = "selfie framing at arm's length"

#: Field groups that are cosmetic and anatomically gender-neutral: an *explicitly
#: locked* value here (from an archetype/cosplayer preset) survives a downstream
#: gender override, because a man can wear bold glam just as a woman can. This lets
#: a forced-Male drag performer keep its glam makeup while *random* men still default
#: to the natural male pool. Only fields whose pools actually differ by gender (e.g.
#: makeup_style) are affected; identical-pool fields already pass the gate.
_GENDER_FLEXIBLE_GROUPS: frozenset[str] = frozenset({"Makeup"})

#: ``set_all_fields`` control values. "All to None" omits every field still on
#: "Random" (a blank-slate baseline) so only locked fields appear; a wired
#: character's signature look is exempt (see :func:`resolve_locked_fields`).
_SET_ALL_OFF = "Off"
_SET_ALL_NONE = "All to None"

#: Reserved key (not a real field) carrying a cosplay character label from a
#: connected Cosplayer node's ``_meta`` through the parsed-archetype dict.
_COSPLAY_LABEL_KEY = "__cosplay_label__"
#: Sentinel a downstream widget sends to mean "use the wired character's own
#: recorded control value" — i.e. honour a vault save's _meta. Distinct from
#: "Any", which is a generation-time choice, not a defer-to-preset.
_AUTO_PRESET = "Auto (preset)"
#: Reserved keys (not real fields) carrying the control values a saved

def _name_already_carries_franchise(name: str, franchise: str) -> bool:
    """True when appending ``(franchise)`` to ``name`` would stutter.

    The 0.77.0 rule ("a franchise-disambiguated key must not restate its franchise
    in the label") was enforced with an exact ``endswith("(<franchise>)")`` test,
    which only catches the case where the parenthetical *is* the franchise. Three
    shipped keys stuttered through that test for years -- "Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan)
    (Marvel)", "Ms. Marvel (Sharon Ventura) (Marvel)" and "Duke Nukem (video game)
    (Duke Nukem)" -- and merging the Persona installments at 0.88.0 added a fourth,
    "Joker (Persona 5) (Persona)". Three shapes, one test:

    * the parenthetical IS the franchise -- "Jinx (League of Legends)";
    * either is a more specific form of the other -- "Mai (Avatar)" under
      "Avatar: The Last Airbender";
    * the base name already says it -- "Ms. Marvel", "Duke Nukem".

    The *narrower* direction of the second shape ("Joker (Persona 5)" under the
    series franchise "Persona") no longer occurs in the roster: 0.90.0 renamed that
    key to "Joker (Persona)" and added a ``validate_data.py`` rule forbidding a
    parenthetical that extends its franchise. The branch below still handles it, as
    defence in depth for data that has not been validated yet.

    Both the prefix test and the base-name test are word-bounded on purpose: a bare
    substring check would fire on any name that happened to contain a short
    franchise string, and a bare prefix check would let a one-letter parenthetical
    swallow a long franchise.

    **Scope, deliberately narrow.** Everything past the exact-match test applies only
    to keys that actually carry a "(...)" disambiguator -- which is what the 0.77.0
    rule is about. It does NOT touch an *eponymous* key whose franchise repeats it
    ("Shrek" under "Shrek", "Godzilla" under "Godzilla", "Sterling Archer" under
    "Archer"). Those render as "Shrek (Shrek)", which is redundant but has shipped
    that way for many releases, and broadening the rule to cover them would rewrite
    91 more entries' prose -- silently invalidating 91 published gallery images,
    since ``entry_hash`` hashes the entry dict and cannot see a prose-only change.
    That is a separate decision with a real re-render bill attached, not a
    side effect of this fix.

    Prose-only -- no RNG draw here, so no seed drift.

_COVERS_FACE_KEY = "__covers_face__"

#: Reserved key carrying a masked character's HEAD description, kept out of the
#: costume string on purpose (0.90.0).
#:
#: It used to be comma-appended to the costume, so "a head wrapped entirely in
#: blood-soaked gauze bandages" arrived as the SIXTH item of a "He wears ..."
#: garment list -- and t2i models rendered the clothes and ignored the head. The
#: maintainer's render review caught it on six entries at once (Silent Hill Nurse,
#: The Ghoul, Figrin D'an, Ithorian, Larfleeze, Dexter Jettster), every one of them
#: reading as an ordinary person in a costume.
#:
#: Same failure and same remedy as the tattoo clause: a description that competes
#: with a long clothing list loses, so it gets its own sentence.
_MASK_KEY = "__mask__"

#: Reserved key carrying a cosplayer's ``anatomy_note`` -- one sentence about the
#: BODY, voiced ahead of the clothing exactly as :data:`_MASK_KEY` is.
#:
#: Added 0.97.0 to close the gap the 0.96.0 limb-count fix left open. That fix works
#: by moving a count into a sentence that renders BEFORE the ``He wears ...`` list,
#: and the only such sentence a non-feral entry had was ``mask`` -- so it could not
#: reach the four multi-armed entries with no mask (``Shiva (Record of Ragnarok)``,
#: ``Salaak``, ``Spiral``, ``Greez Dritus``). This is that sentence, decoupled from
#: the head.
#:
#: **The note describes the body, never the clothes.** Garments belong in ``costume``;
#: putting one here would survive a downstream costume override and contradict it.
#: ``validate_data.py`` rejects a garment noun in the field.
#:
#: Distinct from a FERAL entry's ``anatomy``, which is a ``{slot: text}`` dict routed
#: into the species payload. ``anatomy_note`` is a plain string and is rejected on a
#: feral entry -- a beast already has a per-slot anatomy path and would voice the
#: body twice.
_ANATOMY_NOTE_KEY = "__anatomy_note__"

#: Reserved key carrying a cosplayer's ``covers_body`` flag through the parsed dict
#: (a full hard suit / armour / robot shell / exoskeleton — no skin for worn
#: jewellery to sit on).
_COVERS_BODY_KEY = "__covers_body__"

#: Reserved key carrying a cosplayer's ``covers_hair`` flag through the parsed dict
#: (a hood / cowl / helmet liner / replacing head-tails fully encloses the scalp,
#: but the face still shows — so hair is hidden while Face/Makeup stay).
_COVERS_HAIR_KEY = "__covers_hair__"

#: Reserved key carrying a cosplayer's ``size_scale`` tier ("giant" / "tiny")
#: through the parsed dict. The Cosplayer node already locks the entry's authored
#: ``scale_prose`` into the ``height`` slot, but that only states the scale in prose;
#: the engine needs the tier itself to keep the *scene* coherent with it (see
#: :func:`_scale_coherent_pool`). Travels exactly like the ``covers_*`` flags.
_SCALE_TIER_KEY = "__scale_tier__"

#: ``_meta`` keys that describe the *worn costume* rather than the document as a
#: whole, so a downstream node that supplies its own ``outfit_description`` makes
#: every one of them stale. Read by :func:`merge_preset_documents`, which is where
#: the "downstream wins" contract is enforced -- see its docstring for the leaks
#: this closes (Iron Man's faceplate rendering over a Hogwarts uniform, Godzilla's
#: scale on Hermione, a masked cosplayer suppressing an archetype's whole face).

#: Top-level section name a Modifier node adds to the chained preset document,

_MODIFIERS_DOC_KEY = "_modifiers"

#: Reserved key carrying the parsed modifiers dict through the flattened
#: parsed-archetype dict (double-underscored so it never collides with a field).
_MODIFIERS_KEY = "__modifiers__"

#: JSON group a Creature node adds, holding ``{slot: prose}`` anatomy (a creature
#: head, integument, limbs …). Rendered by a dedicated species path, not the human
#: field engine, so its keys are *not* :data:`FIELD_DEFINITIONS` fields.
_SPECIES_GROUP = "Species & Anatomy"

#: Reserved key carrying the parsed species payload (slots + form + suppression)
#: through the flattened parsed-archetype dict.
_SPECIES_KEY = "__species__"

#: Reserved key carrying an archetype's per-gender variant look blocks
#: (``{"Female": {...}, "Male": {...}}``) through the flattened parsed-archetype
#: dict. Folded into the locks *after* the gender coin-flip so one archetype
#: selection yields either a coherent male or female look.
_VARIANTS_KEY = "__variants__"

#: Canonical transformation-form tokens emitted in a creature document's ``_meta``
#: (the node maps its friendlier widget labels onto these). ``Anthropomorphic`` and
#: ``Feral`` lead the prose with the creature; ``Subtle`` keeps the human subject and
#: appends the creature features as accents.
_FORM_ANTHRO = "Anthropomorphic"
_FORM_FERAL = "Feral"
_FORM_SUBTLE = "Subtle"

#: Order anatomy slots are voiced / serialized in.
_SPECIES_SLOT_ORDER: tuple[str, ...] = (
    "head", "eyes", "integument", "arms", "hands", "legs_feet", "wings", "tail", "extras",
)

#: Field groups suppressed when a cosplayer sets ``covers_face`` — a full mask /
#: helmet / featureless head hides the randomized face, hair and makeup, so
#: describing them would only fight the costume at render time. Body and
#: demographics stay (the person under the mask is still a real body).
#:
#: **A WIDGET lock wins over this block; a preset lock does not (0.84.0).** Until
#: 0.84.0 the block dropped unconditionally, so on a masked character moving the
#: ``hair_color`` widget off ``Random`` did nothing, silently — the dead-widget failure
#: mode 0.83.0 closed for the wardrobe axis, and inconsistent with every other
#: suppression in this module (bald, full-shell skin, ``expression``), all of which
#: honour a lock.
#:
#: The fix keys off ``widget_locked``, **not** ``locked_clean``, and the distinction is
#: load-bearing rather than fussy. ``locked_clean`` merges three sources: the user's own
#: widget choices, a wired preset's authored ``signature`` / ``physique`` / ``eyes``
#: values, and the Cosplayer builder's injected ``"None"`` suppressions. Only the first
#: is a user decision. Measured on the shipped roster: **8 of 295** ``covers_face``
#: entries carry a ``signature`` pin in a concealed field (Princess Leia, The Atom,
#: Bo-Katan Kryze, Night Thrasher, Denji, Katana, Jane Foster Thor, Ermac) — and in every
#: one the mask is an *alternate* costume, so honouring the pin would render Leia's side
#: buns under the Boushh helmet. Honouring ``locked_clean`` here is therefore a
#: regression, not a fix; honouring ``widget_locked`` changes **no** shipped entry until
#: a user deliberately moves a widget.
_CONCEALED_FACE_GROUPS: frozenset[str] = frozenset({"Face", "Hair", "Makeup"})
#: Individual head-worn fields (outside the above groups) a full mask also hides.
_CONCEALED_FACE_FIELDS: frozenset[str] = frozenset({"earrings", "piercings"})

#: Fields a full mask hides that are dropped **only when not explicitly locked** (0.83.0).
#:
#: ``expression`` is the case this exists for. It lives in ``Setting & Shot``, not in
#: ``_CONCEALED_FACE_GROUPS``, so for every release a masked character has been rendering
#: "He wears a plush yordle suit. He is standing with arms crossed. **His expression is
#: steely.**" — a facial expression behind a moulded head. That was mechanical, never a
#: decision.
#:
#: **Why this is still a separate set from ``_CONCEALED_FACE_FIELDS``:** only the
#: membership differs now, not the semantics. Both blocks honour ``widget_locked`` as of
#: 0.84.0, but this one exists because ``expression`` lives in ``Setting & Shot`` — it is
#: not reachable by group, so it has to be named. Keeping it separate also keeps the
#: reason visible: these are fields a mask hides *incidentally*, not fields that describe
#: the head.
#:
#: 0.84.0 narrowed this from ``locked_clean`` to ``widget_locked`` so both blocks share
#: one rule — *the mask hides the face; only your own widget overrides it*. Verified a
#: no-op on shipped data: ``Harley Quinn`` is the only entry whose ``signature`` pins
#: ``expression`` and she is not ``covers_face``, and **no archetype sets
#: ``covers_face`` at all**. It is the future-proof half that matters — a masked entry
#: that pins an expression would otherwise reintroduce the exact bug this closed.
#:
#: ``mood`` deliberately stays: it describes the scene's atmosphere, not the face, and
#: reads fine over a mask. ``smile_type`` needs no entry — it is a Face field and the
#: group block already drops it.
_CONCEALED_FACE_SOFT_FIELDS: frozenset[str] = frozenset({"expression"})

#: Field groups suppressed when a cosplayer sets ``covers_body`` — a full hard
#: suit / armour / robot shell / exoskeleton leaves no bare skin for worn
#: jewellery or nails, so a randomized necklace/bracelet/ring/polish would only
#: render on top of the shell. Body and demographics stay (there is still a body,
#: and the silhouette has a height/build).
_CONCEALED_BODY_GROUPS: frozenset[str] = frozenset({"Jewelry & Nails"})

#: Individual fields dropped alongside ``_CONCEALED_BODY_GROUPS`` for a full shell:
#: ``accessories`` and ``bag`` (Clothing group) are worn/carried *on* the person —
#: sunglasses, a belt, a rattan bag — so a randomized draw would only render on top
#: of a mascot suit / armour shell (the sunglasses-on-Michelin-Man bug). The rest of
#: the Clothing group stays (the costume itself lives there via outfit_description).
#:
#: ``tattoos`` / ``tattoo_placement`` joined at 0.95.0. The tattoo axis shipped at
#: 0.90.0, *after* this set was written, and its standing rule -- ink sits on the body
#: under the costume, which is why it is deliberately absent from
#: ``_COSTUME_SUPPRESSED_EXTRAS`` -- silently assumed there is skin under the costume.
#: On a full shell there is none, so the placement clause described ink on a surface
#: that does not exist: measured at **7.9%** of ``covers_body`` + ``covers_face``
#: renders (38/480 across 60 entries x 8 seeds) -- Iron Man with "a soft watercolor
#: tattoo across the back of one hand", RoboCop with one on the neck, a Cylon
#: Centurion with a blackwork collarbone. Same shape as the 0.92.0 pose-gate finding:
#: a gate that predates the axis it needed to cover. Note this is the *shell* rule,
#: not the costume rule -- a character in ordinary clothes still gets ink.
_CONCEALED_BODY_FIELDS: frozenset[str] = frozenset({
    "accessories", "bag", "tattoos", "tattoo_placement",
})

#: Field groups suppressed when a cosplayer sets ``covers_hair`` — a hood / cowl /
#: helmet-liner (or alien head-tails) fully encloses the scalp while the face still
#: shows, so a randomized "Her hair is ..." line would only contradict the covering.
#: Narrower than ``covers_face`` (which also drops Face + Makeup): here the face is
#: visible, so only the Hair group goes.
_CONCEALED_HAIR_GROUPS: frozenset[str] = frozenset({"Hair"})

#: Scalp-hair fields dropped when ``hair_length`` resolves to "bald" — there is no
#: hair for a colour/texture/style/part/highlight/accessory to describe, so any of
#: them would only contradict the bald head. ``hair_length`` itself stays (it is
#: what voices the bald head) and ``facial_hair`` stays (bald + beard is natural).
#: Mirrors the Cosplayer node's ``_BALD_SUPPRESS`` for costume-declared bald heads.
_BALD_SCALP_FIELDS: tuple[str, ...] = (
    "hair_color", "hair_texture", "hair_style", "hair_part",
    "hair_highlights", "hair_accessory",
)

#: Body/Demographics fields dropped when a character is BOTH fully masked
#: (``covers_face``) AND a full hard shell (``covers_body`` / ``_FULL_COVER_RE``):
#: the being is entirely encased, so a randomized human ``skin_tone`` would render as
#: a stray patch of bare skin under the armour/droid plating (Iron Man, 2-1B, 4-LOM).
#: ``covers_face`` already drops the other skin fields (complexion / skin_details /
#: freckles are Face group; skin_finish is Makeup); only ``skin_tone`` (Body) leaks.
#: ``ethnicity`` (Demographics) joins it as of 0.65.0: it describes the cosplayer under
#: the costume, which is a deliberate design elsewhere (see the Cosplayer node's
#: "Costume only" tooltip), but on an entirely-encased character (Iron Giant, Ultraman,
#: Salacious Crumb, 2-1B, ...) mentioning it only risks biasing the render toward a
#: visible human trait with nothing left to attach it to. An explicit user lock on
#: either field is respected, same as every other suppression in this module.

_CONTROL_FIELDS: frozenset[str] = frozenset(

)

#: Canonical group ordering for prose and JSON output. ``Species & Anatomy`` sits
#: right after Demographics — it sets the substrate the rest is rendered on, and a
#: Modifier node can target the whole group by this name (it reads ``_GROUP_ORDER``).
_GROUP_ORDER: tuple[str, ...] = (
    "Demographics", _SPECIES_GROUP, "Body", "Face", "Hair", "Makeup",
    "Jewelry & Nails", "Clothing", "Nudity & Intimate", "Setting & Shot",
)

#: Tier-gated intimate-detail fields (the ``Nudity & Intimate`` group).
#: Each entry declares its own ``tiers`` in data/fields.py -- the wardrobe
#: levels at which it is visible, hence voiced. ``generate_character`` keeps
#: only the fields active for the resolved tier (a locked value still wins),
#: so a 'Clothed' run never carries a pubic line and a 'Topless' run never a
#: labia line, the same way the tier outfit fields are already culled.

#: Random accessory "extras" dropped when a specific costume is provided

#: A styled costume is a complete, intentional look; a random tote, a wristwatch, a

#: noise (a designer bag on a samurai, a watch on a caped hero, a claw clip on a
#: knight). Explicit locks are respected -- a look that authored a signature scarf
#: (Parisian Chic), flower crown (Cottagecore) or hair comb (Regency) keeps it -- and
#: a plain no-costume run keeps them all (a random modern person may carry/wear them).
#: Jewellery/nails are NOT here: they sit on the body and are governed by the shell
#: rule (a full shell drops the whole Jewelry & Nails group), and a character may
#: coherently wear earrings or a ring over a costume.
#: ``legwear`` joins them at 0.90.0 for the doubling reason rather than the

#: (Lucy) or "knee-high socks" (the school-uniform entries) would otherwise get a

_MAX_CONSTRAINT_ITERATIONS: int = 12

#: The "Auto" sentinel for the manual-only ``size_scale`` control. It is not a tier
#: and is never selected by the randomizer -- ``Auto`` means "say nothing about
#: scale", which is why the field is bias-free by construction. Same contract as the
#: Creature node's ``integument_finish``: adding tiers cannot dilute anything,
#: because nothing is ever drawn from this pool.
_SIZE_SCALE_AUTO: str = "Auto"

#: ``height`` values that are BARE ADJECTIVES, and therefore read wrong in the
#: trailing list of the lead sentence: "a 22-year-old man with an average build
#: **and short**". Voiced as a PRENOMINAL adjective instead -- "a short
#: 22-year-old man with an average build" -- which is the same token in a slot
#: English actually allows, so a t2i prompt keeps the word and loses the wart.
#: Size precedes age in English adjective order, so this goes at the FRONT of the
#: lead, ahead of ``age`` and ``ethnicity``.
#:
#: **Membership is deliberately a literal list, not a computed one.** ``height`` is
#: also the slot :data:`_SIZE_SCALE_PHRASES` and a Cosplayer's ``scale_prose``
#: write into ("colossal and fifty feet tall"), and those are hand-authored phrases
#: that already read correctly where they are. Anything not named here -- the three
#: noun-phrase values, and every free-text override -- stays in the trailing list
#: untouched. ``HeightPrenominalTests`` pins every member against

#: Hand-authored scale phrases, one per tier, that REPLACE the ``height`` value.
#:
#: This reuses the proven Cosplayer ``size_scale`` / ``scale_prose`` machinery: the
#: phrase is locked into the ``height`` slot with override=True, so it renders in the
#: LEAD sentence ("a 34-year-old woman with a slim build, colossal and fifty feet
#: tall, and fair skin") rather than being prepended somewhere weaker. ``height``'s
#: two gender pools are identical, so ``_gender_permits`` short-circuits True and
#: passes the free text through -- the same route the body-paint skin anchor uses.
#:
#: Wording follows the doctrine established across 0.55.0/0.63.0 and must not be
#: "improved" casually:
#:   * CONCRETE MEASUREMENTS, never comparison objects. "beside a towering oak" or
#:     "the size of a mouse" makes t2i render the oak or the mouse.
#:   * Never "insect-sized" / "three apples high" for the same reason.
#:   * Giant tiers pair scale with mass ("hulking", "dwarfing"), because a plain
#:     "very tall" reads as a tall human rather than a change of scale.

#: Tiers that change the subject's *scale* rather than merely their stature, keyed
#: by both vocabularies that reach this code: the widget's tier names above and the
#: Cosplayer entry's ``size_scale`` ("giant"/"tiny").
#:
#: ``short`` and ``large`` are deliberately in NEITHER set. "well over seven feet

_GIANT_TIERS: frozenset[str] = frozenset({"giant", "towering", "colossal"})

#: Framings that can actually carry a change of scale. A subject is only legible as
#: fifty feet tall when the frame holds enough of the world to compare them against,
#: or looks up at them from ground level. Everything else in ``shot_type`` -- every
#: portrait, every medium shot, every profile -- crops the reference away and renders
#: an ordinary person, no matter how emphatic the scale phrase in the prose is.
#:
#: Measured before this existed: 71 giant entries x 30 seeds drew a framing from this
#: set 26.2% of the time and an outdoor location 25.9% of the time, so a giant render
#: that could read as giant was roughly a 1-in-14 event.
#:
#: BIAS: ``shot_type`` is not in FIELD_FAMILIES and carries no ``weights`` map, so the
#: pick is flat uniform and narrowing the pool cannot redistribute anything. Same
#: property the 0.63.0 camera-only rework relied on.

#: The mirror problem at the other end: a six-inch subject in an establishing shot is
#: a few pixels. Only the framings that cannot resolve them at all are dropped -- a
#: tiny subject still reads fine in a close-up or a medium shot, so the tiny tiers get
#: a far lighter touch than the giant ones (and no location rule at all; a doll-sized
#: person indoors beside ordinary furniture is *better* scale evidence, not worse).

#: The only two ``body_type`` values that state *stature* rather than *shape*. They
#: land in the lead sentence two words from the scale phrase -- "a petite and curvy
#: build, colossal and hundreds of feet tall" -- and a flat contradiction beside a
#: high-attention token is exactly the failure the 0.78.0 Krusty fix documented.
#:
#: Deliberately narrow: "very slim" / "slender" / "lean" describe build, not size, and
#: a slender fifty-foot figure is perfectly coherent. Culling those would trade a real
#: contradiction for lost variety. ``body_type`` is flat (no families, no weights), so
#: removing two of nineteen values is bias-free.
_STATURE_BODY_TYPES: frozenset[str] = frozenset({"petite and slim", "petite and curvy"})

#: ``composition`` values that fight an EXTREME scale, split by which end they fail at.
#:
#: The fourth field of the giant gate, added 0.97.0 to close a measured gap: the scale
#: gate narrowed ``location``, ``shot_type``, ``body_type`` and ``pose`` but not
#: ``composition``, so a forty-foot subject could still draw "composed with the subject
#: filling most of the frame" -- which removes the very surroundings the other three
#: rules work to keep in shot. Observed on ``Falkor``.
#:
#: The two ends fail for opposite reasons, so they get their own sets:
#:
#: * **Giant** -- a frame with nothing but the subject in it has nothing to measure
#:   the subject against, and "colossal and fifty feet tall" is a claim about a
#:   *relationship*. Both survivors here are the framings that crop the world away.
#: * **Tiny** -- the mirror of :data:`_SHOTS_TOO_WIDE_FOR_TINY`, and the same single
#:   value it is built from: a doll-sized subject rendered deliberately small in a
#:   large empty frame resolves to nothing. A tight crop is *good* evidence at that
#:   end, so the tiny set stays a single value, matching the lighter touch the tiny
#:   tiers get everywhere else.
#:
#: BIAS: ``composition`` is flat -- no ``FIELD_FAMILIES`` entry, no ``weights`` map --
#: so the survivors stay uniform over each other. This is the partial cull that
#: architecture.md's "A flat field is where a partial cull is FINE" sanctions, and it
#: is the same property ``shot_type`` and ``body_type`` pass on.
#:
#: Four of the eight values are ALSO in ``_ENVIRONMENT_DEPENDENT_COMPOSITIONS``
#: (``data/constraints.py``), which culls them in a studio. The two rules compose:
#: worst case for a giant in a studio the pool narrows to two, and the ``or pool``
#: fallback below means an empty result keeps the value rather than raising.

#: Probability that a randomized skin tone is drawn from the ethnicity's

SKIN_TONE_INBAND_PROBABILITY: float = 0.8

#: The believable human skin tones. A resolved ``skin_tone`` *outside* this set is a

#: restated on the face (see _format_prose), because the opening sentence anchors it on
#: the body only and t2i otherwise renders the high-attention face from the (colourless)

#: "Extra" fields (bags, jewellery, accessories) plus the two "sometimes" skin

#: otherwise drowned out by its present options — leaving ~90% of characters

#: rare items (bag, accessories) lean more absent than everyday jewellery
#: (necklace, earrings). Freckles/marks lean mostly-absent so they read as a
#: distinguishing feature, not a default.
#:
#: **The probability is a FLOOR, not the realized rate.** :func:`_maybe_absent` rolls

#: absent value, so it can come up absent a second way. The realized rate is therefore
#: ``base + (1 - base) / len(pool)``, plus whatever the constraint engine's masculine

    The ``pose`` field is written as a gesture a *person* performs, which quietly
    assumes a person's parts: "running one hand through the hair" needs scalp hair,
    "posing with hands in pockets" and "touching the collar with one hand" need a
    worn garment *with pockets and a collar*. A fully masked / hooded / bald character
    has no hair to touch; a full hard shell or non-skin body (fur, plating, flame) has
    no pockets or collar (the Moogle-with-a-hairstyle-gesture bug); and a pocketless,
    collarless garment — swimwear, a leotard, a gown, a toga — has neither either, so
    the garment gestures are dropped for it the same way (hands-in-pockets on a bikini).

    A third assumption joined at 0.84.0: a pose that occupies **both hands** assumes the
    hands are empty. With the Cosplayer node's signature prop switched on, the prose
    rendered *"She is posing with hands in pockets, holding Mjolnir"* — measured at
    **14.37%** of prop-enabled renders, across 468 of 1,732 cosplayers that carry a
    ``prop``. One-handed poses are deliberately kept: the free hand holds the prop, which
    is the natural reading, so only :data:`HAND_OCCUPIED_POSES` goes.

    A fourth, 0.85.0: ``shot_type`` locked to the selfie framing assumes the same thing
    a held prop does — one hand is occupied holding the camera at arm's length, so
    :data:`HAND_OCCUPIED_POSES` drops for the same reason, reusing the existing set
    rather than hand-listing a selfie-specific subset.

    Reads ``hair_length``, ``outfit_description`` and ``held_item`` straight out of
    ``resolved`` rather than taking more parameters: ``pose`` is drawn after all three
    (field indices 24/46 vs 67, and ``held_item`` is a preset-only lock present from the
    first line of :func:`_randomize_fields`), so their final values — locked *or*
    randomized — are already in hand. That also means an auto-detected shell (a randomly
    drawn plate-armour outfit) is caught without the caller having to flag it.

    Both bald routes count: the engine's own "bald" ``hair_length``, and the
    Cosplayer node's ``_BALD_SUPPRESS``, which locks the scalp fields to an *absent*
    value instead (never to "bald" — that option is male-only and would be
    gender-gated). Absent hair means no hair is described at all, so a hair gesture
    is unsupported either way.

    A fifth, 0.95.0: ``feral`` means the subject has no upright, two-armed human body
    at all -- a cosplay entry with ``body_plan: "feral"`` or a Creature node on the
    Feral form. Every remaining gesture assumes arms and a hip, so
    :data:`QUADRUPED_UNPERFORMABLE_POSES` goes as a block. It overlaps the three sets
    above on purpose: the Creature node's Feral form sets none of the ``covers_*``
    flags (it suppresses by group instead), so without this its beasts kept crossing
    arms they do not have.

    Whole families are removed, never single values, so the remaining families keep
    their proportional shares (see POSE_FAMILIES). Returns ``pool`` unchanged when
    nothing applies, and never returns empty.

    then nothing downstream shifts, because nothing downstream draws.

    A preset costume was already in ``resolved`` during the loop, so its poses were

    """Narrow a scene/build pool so the render can actually show the subject's scale.

    An extreme change of scale is the one thing the prose cannot establish on its own.
    "Colossal and fifty feet tall" is a claim about the *relationship* between the
    subject and everything around them, so it only survives into the image when the
    frame contains something to measure against. Five fields decide that:

    * ``shot_type`` -- must hold a framing that keeps the world in shot, or looks up
      from ground level (:data:`_SCALE_SHOWING_SHOTS`).
    * ``location`` -- must be outdoors. A fifty-foot figure in a nail salon has no
      room to be fifty feet, and the interior sets the ceiling height that the model
      then draws the subject inside.
    * ``body_type`` -- must not simultaneously call the subject petite
      (:data:`_STATURE_BODY_TYPES`).
    * ``pose`` -- must not require furniture (:data:`FURNITURE_DEPENDENT_POSES`). This
      is a *consequence* of the location rule rather than an independent one: forcing
      the scene outdoors leaves no seat to perch on the edge of. Added 0.84.0; an audit
      of all 38 poses at giant scale found this to be the only genuinely impossible one
      (`leaning against a wall` reads better at scale, not worse -- the wall becomes a
      building).
    * ``composition`` -- must not crop the world away
      (:data:`_COMPOSITIONS_TOO_TIGHT_FOR_GIANT`). Added 0.97.0; without it the other
      three rules could keep the surroundings in shot and ``composition`` could then
      throw them out again, which is what "the subject filling most of the frame"
      did on ``Falkor``.

    Only the giant class takes all five; ``tiny`` takes the two framing rules, each in
    its own lighter form (:data:`_SHOTS_TOO_WIDE_FOR_TINY`,
    :data:`_COMPOSITIONS_TOO_WIDE_FOR_TINY`). A three-foot subject perched on the edge
    of a seat is fine, so the pose rule is giant-only, and so is the location rule.

    **This is called from the randomize loop, which has already skipped every locked
    field, so an explicit user lock is never narrowed** -- lock ``location`` to a
    kitchen and you get the kitchen. An empty result also falls back to ``pool``
    rather than failing: ``location_setting: Indoor`` plus a giant is a contradiction
    the user asked for, and the 0.63.0 empty-studio-pool precedent is to keep the
    value rather than raise.

    **BIAS.** All five fields are safe, each for its own reason. ``composition`` is
    flat (no ``FIELD_FAMILIES`` entry, no ``weights`` map), the same property that
    clears ``shot_type`` below. ``shot_type`` and
    ``body_type`` are flat -- no ``FIELD_FAMILIES`` entry, no ``weights`` map -- so a
    narrowed pool stays uniform over the survivors. ``pose`` is family-weighted and
    passes because ``FURNITURE_DEPENDENT_POSES`` is exactly the ``seated_perch`` family,
    split out at 0.84.0 for this rule -- a WHOLE family, so the other eleven stay
    proportional. ``location`` *is* family-weighted,
    and it passes because its twelve families bucket perfectly: ``domestic``,
    ``food_drink``, ``retail_services``, ``leisure_fitness``, ``civic_institutional``,
    ``work_industrial`` and ``transit_travel`` are entirely indoor; ``urban_outdoor``,
    ``urban_landmark``, ``nature_outdoor`` and ``nature_landmark`` are entirely
    outdoor; ``studio`` is neither and is already excluded by every
    ``location_setting`` except its own. Filtering to outdoors therefore drops eight
    WHOLE families and leaves the surviving four proportional to each other -- the
    whole-unit drop the family-weight rule requires, never the partial cull that
    concentrates a frozen weight. This is also why the shipped
    ``location_setting: Outdoor`` control has never skewed anything.

    (The family list above was written when there were nine and went stale as the
    roster grew; it is re-verified mechanically by ``LocationFamilyBucketTests``, so
    a future family that straddles the boundary fails the suite rather than quietly
    skewing a giant's scenery.)

    requirement rules. Neither saw the other's bans on the same trigger, so each

    Lets the preset nodes chain: an upstream preset's ``character_json`` is merged
    *under* this node's own output, so wiring ``Archetype -> Cosplayer ->
    IdentityForge`` keeps both connected. A node set to ``"None"`` emits ``"{}"``,
    which here passes the upstream through unchanged. On overlap the downstream
    (own) document wins, field by field, including ``_meta`` keys. ``_meta`` is
    emitted first and groups follow :data:`_GROUP_ORDER` for readable output.

    Either input may be empty, ``"{}"`` or malformed; the result is always a
    valid JSON object string.

    **"Own wins" has to hold for the reserved ``_meta`` keys too, not just fields.**
    A plain key-by-key merge honours it only for keys the downstream node actually
    writes, and two classes of key escaped that:

    * :data:`_COSTUME_META_KEYS` describe the *worn costume*, and the Cosplayer node
      writes ``covers_face`` / ``covers_body`` / ``covers_hair`` unconditionally
      (even when false) precisely so a downstream node overrides an upstream one --
      but ``mask`` and ``size_scale`` were only written when present, so they
      survived. Chaining Cosplayer "Iron Man" -> Cosplayer "Hermione Granger"
      correctly reset ``covers_face`` to false and still rendered "She has a
      faceplate with narrow glowing eye slits" over the Hogwarts uniform; via
      Godzilla it also leaked ``size_scale: giant`` and its authored ``height``.
      The Archetype / Creature / Modifier nodes write *none* of the five, so
      Cosplayer -> Archetype leaked all of them at once -- a ballerina in a tutu
      with Iron Man's faceplate, no face, no hair and no jewellery.
    * ``_meta.variants`` carries a per-gender archetype's two look blocks, and
      :func:`generate_character` folds the matching one in *after* the merged locks,
      so it beat everything downstream of it. Archetype "Battle Bard" -> Cosplayer
      "Hermione Granger" merged the Hogwarts uniform correctly into ``Clothing`` and
      then rendered the Bard's velvet doublet, speakeasy, string lights and cheerful
      mood over it, still labelled "Cosplaying as Hermione Granger". 34 archetypes
      carry variants.

    Both are fixed here rather than downstream because this is where the precedence
    contract lives -- and fixing it here covers every node pairing at once, including
    hand-authored documents, instead of patching each emitter. The rule for the
    costume keys is that a document supplying its own ``outfit_description`` replaces
    the *look*, so the upstream's costume-derived state is stale; the rule for
    variants is plain field-level precedence.

    The seed is intentionally excluded — it is run-control noise, not part of
    the character description. A connected creature's ``Species & Anatomy`` group
    is re-emitted (in canonical order) alongside its identifying ``_meta``.

    **The document has to be self-describing, because the vault round-trips it.**
    ``prompt_json`` is exactly what Vault Save writes to disk, and Vault Load feeds it
    straight back into ``archetype_json`` — the node's stated promise being that "a
    single saved document captures the whole character regardless of how the graph was
    wired". It did not. Two omissions compounded:

    * The concealment state (``covers_face`` / ``covers_body`` / ``covers_hair`` /
      ``mask`` / ``size_scale``) lived only on the Cosplayer node's document, never on
      this one. So recall restored Iron Man's costume but not the *reasons* it hid
      anything: the faceplate sentence vanished and a full randomized face, hair and
      makeup were generated under the armour, with a stray ethnicity and skin tone on
      a fully-encased character.
    * :func:`group_fields` strips ``"None"``, which is precisely the token the
      Cosplayer builder injects to suppress a field. She-Hulk's ``ethnicity: "None"``
      therefore did not survive, and a randomized ethnicity reappeared under the body
      paint — the exact failure 0.78.0 added that suppression to fix.

    Both are recorded here, so recall needs no changes on the load side:
    :func:`_parse_archetype_json` already reads the five costume keys, and now reads
    ``omitted`` as well. ``omitted`` lists only *explicitly locked* absences, never a
    field that merely randomized to nothing, so a plain run records an empty list and

    ``locked`` maps field_name → chosen value for every user-locked field
    (control fields excluded). A locked ``outfit_description`` is honoured as a
    costume, overriding the generated outfit (used by costume archetypes).

    ``wardrobe_level`` (``Clothed`` / ``Swimwear`` / ``Lingerie`` / ``Topless`` /
    ``Fully nude``) selects the outfit tier; any non-``Clothed`` value replaces
    the generated outfit with the tier's own fields and drops the clothed-only
    fields. A supplied costume still wins over the tier. The API default stays
    neutral (``Clothed``): the node's *widget* defaults to ``Lingerie``,
    because this is a nude-prompt generator; a bare library call is not.

    ``cosplay_label`` (e.g. ``"2B (NieR: Automata)"``), when set by a connected
    Cosplayer node, prefixes the prose and is recorded in the JSON ``_meta``.

    ``covers_face`` (set by a full-mask cosplayer) drops the randomized face,
    hair and makeup so only the costume's mask/helmet is described.

    ``covers_body`` (set by a full hard-suit / armour / robot / exoskeleton
    cosplayer) drops the randomized Jewelry & Nails group so no necklace, ring or
    nail polish renders on top of the shell. When a character is both ``covers_face``
    and a full shell it is entirely encased, so the leaking Body ``skin_tone`` is
    dropped too (no bare skin shows under the armour/droid plating).

    ``covers_hair`` (set by a hooded / cowled / lekku cosplayer whose face still
    shows) drops only the randomized Hair group, so no "Her hair is ..." line
    contradicts the head covering while the face is still described.

    ``widget_locked`` names the fields whose **widget on this node** the user moved off
    ``"Random"``. It is deliberately narrower than ``locked``: see
    :data:`_CONCEALED_FACE_GROUPS` for why the concealment blocks need to tell a user's
    own choice apart from a wired preset's authored look. ``None`` (the default) means
    "no widget locks", so every caller that does not pass it is unaffected.

    ``modifiers`` (set by a connected Modifier node) maps a field name or group
    header to a descriptor that is prepended to the matching resolved value(s),
    e.g. ``{"footwear": "sci-fi"}`` → "sci-fi white sneakers".

    ``species`` (set by a connected Creature node) carries non-human anatomy: a
    ``slots`` map of ``{slot: prose}``, a ``form`` token and ``suppress_groups`` /
    ``suppress_fields`` lists. The suppressed human fields are dropped (a creature
    head hides the face/hair, a creature integument hides the skin) and the slots
    are woven into both outputs by the species-aware formatters.

    ``gender_variants`` (set by a per-gender archetype) maps ``"Female"`` /
    ``"Male"`` to a look block; once the gender is settled the matching block is
    folded into the locks, so one archetype selection yields a coherent male or
    female look (e.g. a housewife dress vs a suburban-dad sweater-vest).

    ``size_scale`` is a MANUAL-ONLY override. ``"Auto"`` (the default) leaves scale
    unstated and is never chosen by the randomizer, so the control cannot bias any
    distribution. Any other tier replaces the ``height`` value with a hand-authored
    scale phrase, letting a perfectly ordinary randomized person be rendered
    towering or doll-sized. A cosplayer's own ``size_scale`` wins, so selecting a
    tier cannot shrink a canonically giant character.

    ``character_scale`` is a wired Cosplayer entry's own ``size_scale`` tier. It does
    not set the height (the Cosplayer node already locked its authored ``scale_prose``
    into that slot); it tells the engine which scale is in play so the framing,
    location and build stay coherent with it.
